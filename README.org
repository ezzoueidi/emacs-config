# My Emacs configuration files
* My Emacs configuration files

The init.org is the configuration file with full commentary.

See init.el for the resulting configuration file which is loaded by Emacs. This file is generated automatically from init.org using Org-mode.

See custom.el for all the settings maintained through Emacsâ€™ customization mechanism. Some of these values are set in my init file, others are set by hand.
