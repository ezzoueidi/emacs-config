the file used by the standard `org-archive' functions if you
enable command `org-gtd-mode'.  If not, this will be used only by
org-gtd's archive behavior.

This function has an arity of zero.  By default this generates a file
called gtd_archive_<currentyear> in `org-gtd-directory' and puts the entries

confirmation regardless of the number of options.  Note that setting this to
false does not mean you can safely create new targets.  See the documentation
to create new refile targets.
